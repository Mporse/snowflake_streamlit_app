# Snowflake Streamlit App
Streamlit app created as part of the Snowflake Unviersity course [Data Application Builders Workshop (DABW)](https://learn.snowflake.com/courses/course-v1:snowflake+ESS-DABW+A/about).

The code is used for a Streamlit application that interacts with the Fruityvice API (for sending GET requests) and with Snowflake (for storing user input in a cloud data warehouse).

The code has been forked from my other account.
