# Snowflake Streamlit App
Streamlit app created as part of the Snowflake DABW course (forked from a repo I created on another account).  

The code is used for a Streamlit application that interacts with the Fruityvice API (for sending GET requests) and with Snowflake (for storing user input in a cloud data warehouse).
